Setting up the environment was quite the challenge for me, as I haven't done something like this in the past. My
particular point of struggle was getting configuring Tensorflow to use my Nvidia GPU. This required me to install
different Nvidia drivers and tools. Below is the process I followed.

First off, I attempted to simply install Tensorflow (referenced as TF from now on) and check to see if it recognized
my GPU. When this didn't work, I began looking up how to do this. I found out pretty quickly I need CUDA installed.
I kept seeing mention of Conda, so I set that up. I originally went with an Anaconda installation, but later switched
to miniconda to avoid the large amount of extra installation size. Once miniconda was set up, I took to installing
CUDA. After multiple attempts, I learned that on Windows, TF is only natively supported up to version 2.10, and v2.10
only supports up to a specific CUDA version. So, I downloaded the necessary drivers, installed CUDA version 11.2, and
added cudnn version 8.1. From there, I created a miniconda instance, installed the necessary packages, and then pointed
my IDE (DataSpell) at it. Finally, after all the configuration, I was able to get TF to recognize my GPU!
